# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a less common bug in Tailwind CSS where gradients might not render correctly. This can be caused by incorrect configuration or conflicts with other CSS rules.

## Bug Description

A gradient background, created using Tailwind's `bg-gradient-to-r` utility class, fails to render properly. The issue might manifest as an unexpected color, lack of gradient, or no visible background change at all.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the Tailwind configuration, ensuring the correct installation of necessary plugins, and checking for any CSS conflicts.  It often requires closer examination of the CSS being applied to the element.
