```javascript
// Ensure Tailwind is correctly configured and that the gradient plugin is installed (if required)
// Check for conflicting CSS rules that might override the gradient styles. Using browser developer tools to inspect the element is recommended.

// Verify the Tailwind directives are correctly imported into your CSS files.

// If using a CSS preprocessor, make sure the gradient syntax is compatible

// Check if any parent elements have conflicting background properties.  Consider using the !important flag if necessary, but use cautiously
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg !important">
  <h1>This is a gradient background</h1>
</div>
