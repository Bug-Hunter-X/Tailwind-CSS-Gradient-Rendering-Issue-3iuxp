```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg">
  <h1>This is a gradient background</h1>
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's `bg-gradient-to-r` class to create a gradient background, but it might not render correctly in some cases.  The issue could be caused by an incorrect configuration of Tailwind's `gradient` feature or a conflict with other CSS rules. This is less common, but could show up as an unexpected color or lack of gradient.
